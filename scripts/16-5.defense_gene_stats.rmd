## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Counting matrix for each subject will be too large after merging, so a loop will be adopted to summarize the counts independently.
## Subject 2039 will be the example.

### Mapping result is summarized to get the subject, time point, sample read count (total number of mapped reads in a sample)..
```{r}
mapping_counts <- read.delim('~/crisprome/hmp/intermediates/16.antiphage_machinery_stats/simplified_counts/MGX/2039_MGX_simplified_featureCounts.txt', sep = '\t', header = F)
colnames(mapping_counts) <- c("gene_name", "CDS", "sample", "mapping_count", "subject")
samples <- as.data.frame(mapping_counts$sample)
samples <- separate(data = samples, col = `mapping_counts$sample`, sep = "_", into = c("subject", "time_point", "hospital", "disease", "data_type", "file_extension"))
mapping_counts <- cbind(mapping_counts, samples[2:5])
sample_read_counts <- mapping_counts %>% group_by(sample, subject, time_point) %>% summarize(sample_read_count = sum(mapping_count))
mapping_counts <- left_join(mapping_counts, sample_read_counts, by = c("sample", "subject", "time_point"))
```

### Summarize annotation of CDS (prediction of defense related genes) to get gene lengths, average system sizes, etc.
```{r}
cds <- read.delim("~/crisprome/hmp/intermediates/16.antiphage_machinery_stats/gene_annotation/16-1-3.2039_cds_with_fine_annotation.txt", sep = "\t", header = T)
cds <- cds[, -c(31, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45)]
colnames(cds)[14] <- "sys_id"
cds$gene_len <- as.numeric(str_remove_all(cds$gene_len, pattern = "gene_len="))
# cds$gene_len <- cds$gene_len + 1       # gene length should be end-start+1, +1 was omitted in previous script.

defense_cds <- cds %>% filter(gene_name != "non-defense-gene")
system_gene_counts <- defense_cds %>% group_by(type, sys_id) %>% summarize(system_gene_count = n()) # summarize the number of genes in each system
type_gene_counts <- system_gene_counts %>% group_by(type) %>% summarize(type_gene_count = sum(system_gene_count)) # summarize the number of genes belonging to one type of system.
system_counts <- system_gene_counts %>% group_by(type) %>% summarize(type_count = n()) # summarize the number of systems of one type.
system_average_gene_counts <- left_join(system_counts, type_gene_counts, by = "type")
system_average_gene_counts$system_average_gene_count <- system_average_gene_counts$type_gene_count / system_average_gene_counts$type_count # calculate the average number of gene in one type of system.
n_distinct(system_average_gene_counts$type)
defense_cds <- left_join(defense_cds, system_average_gene_counts[, c(1, 4)], by = "type")
```

### Merge the summarized mapping results and CDS annotations, and the normalized mapping counts are calculated.
```{r}
mapping_matrix <- left_join(mapping_counts, defense_cds, by = c("subject", "CDS", "gene_name"))
defense_mapping_matrix <- mapping_matrix %>% filter(gene_name != "non-defense-gene")
defense_gene_proportions <- defense_mapping_matrix %>% group_by(sample, subject, time_point, sample_read_count) %>% summarize(defense_gene_mapping_count = sum(mapping_count))
defense_gene_proportions %>% ggplot(aes(x = as.character.numeric_version(as.numeric(str_remove_all(time_point, "C"))))) +
  geom_col(aes(y = defense_gene_mapping_count / sample_read_count * 100), width = 0.8, fill = '#bdbdbd') + 
  geom_line(aes(y = sample_read_count / 5e+7))
```
