## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Set path and load library
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(randomcoloR)

setwd("~/crisprome/hmp/scripts/")
```

## Summarize the positions of predicted defense systems, and other information of the system (type, subtype, gene count, wholeness, score, etc.)
